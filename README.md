## Simple Fantasy Football Data Grid built using ag-grid

# Seed for project was forked from [here](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-react-seed)

This grid lets you see the full set of data available from The Premier League for their [fantasy football game](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/). Raw data was taken from [here](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/bootstrap-static).

It's hard through The Premier League website to view player data across teams, and to filter it and sort it in a powerful way. With this grid, for example, you can now see the players who are in the best form but are also low in cost of low in pick percentage, giving you a differentiator against your opposition. And we all love winning at fantasy football!

Players are initally grouped by teams, but this can be switched off with the "Toggle Grouping" button.
